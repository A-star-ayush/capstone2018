@Server
Have the message parsing function return the passed message as it is without calling JSON.parse first. Because while replying request we are first doing JSON.parse and then JSON.stringify
Ask the worker for its capacity
Error checking for other types (other than data and analytic) at the time of adding them to the pool of workers
Reschedule the requests assigned to the worker that just closed / exited
If no connection within a timeout,  close worker registration
Reclaim the port number upon after worker exists
Something about that address already in use error that was encountered once

@Data-worker
Check the output of JSON.stringify without parsing the query results and establish the need of parsing the results

@Analytic-worker
Can perform some periodic regression even when there is no request
